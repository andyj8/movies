<p>IMPORTANT READ CAREFULLY: This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) is a legal and binding agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) (“You” or “Your”) and Sonic Solutions LLC (“Rovi”), a subsidiary of Rovi Corporation, for the software product You are about to access and the associated proprietary media, printed materials, any associated documentation (including any electronic documentation), and also any updates or modifications of the foregoing provided by Rovi or its licensees or agents to You (collectively, the “Product”).<br />
<br />WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE “ACCEPT” BUTTON OR WHEN YOU OTHERWISE USE ANY PART OF THE PRODUCT, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO (OR CANNOT COMPLY WITH) ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, DO NOT USE ANY PART OF THE PRODUCT (AND, IF APPLICABLE, CLICK THE “DECLINE” BUTTON), AND YOU WILL NOT BE AUTHORIZED TO USE OR HAVE ANY LICENSE TO USE ANY PART OF THE PRODUCT.</p>
<br />
<p>1. GRANT OF LICENSE. This Product is licensed, not sold, to You by Rovi for use under the terms of this EULA and Rovi reserves all rights not granted to you herein. You may freely use the Product, provided that you do not modify or alter the Product or remove any logo, name, trademark, service mark, copyright or other notices, and provided that you do not attempt to circumvent the security associated with any content offered through this Product. You may not add your own trademark, logo, name or other notice to the Product, nor may you add or remove any functionality or code in the Product. You may not sell, license, rent, lease or distribute the Product in any manner <br />
2. PRODUCT COMPONENTS. The Product may consist of one or more of the following components:<br />
a) <u>File Management</u>. The file management tools assist in the downloading, streaming, maintaining and deleting of content files stored on your device and provide you with details about your downloaded content such as license status and expiration. The Product may automatically delete downloaded content with expired content licenses from your device. YOU AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY DELETE SUCH EXPIRED CONTENT FROM YOUR DEVICE. In addition, there may be periods of time (“Black Out Windows”) where your content becomes unavailable due to licensing restrictions from third party content providers. YOU AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE SUCH CONTENT FROM YOUR DEVICE, AND THAT ACCESS TO SUCH CONTENT WILL BE REINSTATED IF AND WHEN THE BLACK OUT WINDOW HAS EXPIRED.<br />
b) <u>Automatic Updating</u>. When your device is connected to the Internet, the Product may communicate, via remote activation or otherwise, with Rovi, and/or the companies with which Rovi does business (“Suppliers”), with regard to the need for periodic updates, modifications and/or reinstallations (“Updates”) to address security, interoperability, performance, and other issues. You consent that Rovi and its Suppliers may periodically make such communications remotely and download such Updates to the Product stored on your device without further notice to you and that such Updates shall be incorporated into this EULA under the definition of Product and thus subject to the same use restrictions.<br />
c) <u>Digital Rights Management</u>. Rovi is using digital rights management (“DRM”) software (any of which may be referred to herein as “DRM Software”) to protect the integrity of certain content (“Secure Content”) so that the intellectual property, including copyrights, in such content is not misappropriated. Portions of the Product use DRM Software to play Secure Content. If the DRM Software’s security has been compromised, the DRM Software may revoke the DRM Software’s right to copy, display and/or play Secure Content. Revocation does not alter the DRM Software’s ability to play unprotected content. A list of revoked DRM Software may be sent to your device whenever you download a license for Secure Content from the Internet. Rovi may also require you to upgrade some of the DRM components (“DRM Upgrades”) before accessing the content. DRM Software may notify you that a DRM Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent before the DRM Upgrade is downloaded, or it may automatically update the Product without asking for your consent. If you decline an upgrade, you may not be able to access content that requires the DRM Upgrade; however, you will still be able to access unprotected content and Secure Content that does not require the upgrade. <br />
3. NO TRANSCODING. You are prohibited from using this Product with a software or hardware product whose purpose is to “transcode” or convert the video content into an alternate video format or to “rip” the audio or video track from any audio/visual work. <br />
4. OTHER RESTRICTIONS:<br />
a) You are expressly prohibited from modifying, merging, selling, leasing, or assigning, in any manner, the Product or any portion thereof.<br />
b) You are also expressly prohibited from (and assisting others in) reverse engineering, decompiling, translating, disassembling, deciphering, decrypting, or otherwise attempting to discover the source code of the Product as the Product contains proprietary material of Rovi. You may not otherwise modify, alter, adapt, port, or merge the Product. You agree not to violate or attempt to violate any security components of the Product for any reason whatsoever. You shall not access or attempt to access a user account that you are not authorized to access. <br />
c) You may not remove, alter, deface, overprint or otherwise obscure Rovi patent, trademark, service mark or copyright notices or logos.<br />
5. THIRD PARTY REFERENCES AND MATERIAL. References made either in the Product or in the data displayed using the Product may include reference to products, services, or trademarks of third parties. No such reference(s) shall constitute or imply an endorsement or recommendation by Rovi. <br />

a) <u>Acknowledgment Of Ownership In Content And Product</u>. You agree that the content, including but not limited to the content of motion pictures, television shows, graphics, audio clips, and editorial content, contains proprietary information and material that is owned by Rovi and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary information or materials in any way whatsoever except for use of the Product in compliance with the terms of this EULA. Moreover, you explicitly agree that any reference to “purchase” or similar terms in the EULA or elsewhere refers to the commercial transaction granting you access to a copy of the content to be used solely for personal, non-commercial use, and does not purport to and does not transfer any ownership interest in any manner of the intellectual property in the content to you. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works obtained via the Product, in any manner.<br />
b) <u>Copyrights/Trademarks</u>. The title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Product are owned by Rovi and/or its licensors.
